# What It Is?
> A movement first 3D-platformer G3N engine demo.

Itsa was originally based on [G3NView](https://github.com/g3n/demos/tree/master/g3nview) 
& was an excuse to learn a little about 3D animation; It's quickly (d)evolved into   
wanting to make a general purpose 3D-Platformer Sandbox Demo. lol

I have zero idea what I'm doing / You probably shouldn't use this as a reference for 
idiomatic G3N code, until there's a formal tagged release.

- Everything.
